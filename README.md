# ML-ObesityAnalysis
I believe that lower socioeconomic status and poorer conditions would lead to a higher rate of obesity within the United States. I also believe that average obesity rates have increased in each state over the past few years. I aim to measure socioeconomic status by using the average income level in each state which would be one of our  independent variables. Another independent variable would be education attainment by state based on receiving a bachelors or higher, as it would be a predictor for a higher average socioeconomic status. The third variable to measure socioeconomic status would be median home value in each state. For this project, I used Google Colab and Python modules to visualize my data and create the models. I used statistical methods of analysis to prove my hypothesis and test the results of my model.
