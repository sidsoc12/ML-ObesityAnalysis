# ML-ObesityAnalysis
I believe that lower socioeconomic status and poorer conditions would lead to a higher chance of obesity in a community. I also believe that average obesity rates have increased in each state over the past few years. I aim to measure socioeconomic status by using the average income level in each state which would be one of our  independent variables. Another independent variable would be education attainment by state based on receiving a bachelors or higher, as it would be a predictor for a higher average socioeconomic status. The third variable to measure socioeconomic status would be median home value in each state. I believe that a higher median home value would signify a higher average socioeconomic status for each state. The dependent variable would be the rate of obesity for each state.
